{% block title %}Simple Transient Detection for the Web{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

  <p>
    This is a simple web-based tool for a quick-look photometry and transient detection in astronomical images. It is based on <a href="https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe">STDPipe</a> library and tries to implement a self-consistent and mostly automatic data analysis workflow from its routines.
  </p>

  <p>
    It currently allows you to:
    <ul>
      <li>Upload your own FITS files, or analyze some files already on the server</li>
      <li>Do basic pre-processing and masking</li>
      <li>Detect objects in the image and do astrometric calibration, either by blind mathcing or refining existing solution</li>
      <li>Photometrically calibrate the image using one of supported reference catalogues</li>
      <li>Subtract either user-provided or automatically downloaded template images</li>
      <li>Do forced photometry for a specified target in either original or difference image</li>
      <li>Do (experimental) transient detection in difference image</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to better understand the routines used for it, please consult STDPipe <a href="https://stdpipe.readthedocs.io/">documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdpipe/tree/master/notebooks">example notebooks</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/karpov-sv/stdweb">actual source code</a> behind this website.

          You may upload new FITS image here. Upon uploading, you will be redirected to the dedicated task page for this image, where you may analyze it.

        <p>
          You may set a free-form title or comment for the image. Also, you may select some configuration preset that will pre-fill some processing parameters. Moreover, you may directly specify the target name or coordinates, and initiate automatic execution of some of processing steps by using the checkboxes below the form.
